Feature: This is basic BDD test

In order to check BDD basic files

As a Automation engineer

I want to validate basic BDD

Scenario: I need to check all keywords within BDD framework to test





Given I am tester
When i want to run test 
Then  I will run test
And  Test looks good
But  Validation on test required

Scenario: I need to check all keywords within BDD multiframework

When i want to run test "<alpha>" 
Then  I will run test "<beta>"
And  Test looks good "<gamma>"
But  Validation on test required "<jgj>"

Examples:

|alpha|beta|gamma|jgj|
|abc  |def |geh  |jai ho|
|ijk  |lmn |opq  |jai ho|
